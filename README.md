# QuizCodeWarrior

## Description
This project is a dynamic and interactive web-based JavaScript quiz designed to test users on their JavaScript fundamentals. The motivation behind creating this quiz was to provide a fun and engaging way for learners to test their JavaScript knowledge. This project addresses the need for an interactive learning tool in the field of web development education. Building this project helped me to deepen my understanding of JavaScript, particularly in handling DOM manipulation and event-driven programming.
